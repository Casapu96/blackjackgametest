## About The Project

This project goal was to create a blackjack card game in a preferred programming language. The game was coded using Python and had the following functionalities: <br/>
1:  Defining randomly a card to the player and the computer.<br/>
2: Calculating the score based on the numbers given.<br/>
3: Providing conditional statements that will highlight the game rules, such as: if the player score is higher than 21, the computer wins, or if the player score is equal with the computer score it is a draw.<br/>
4: Providing an additional input that would ask the player for another card in case the number is less than 21 and the player wants to continue.<br/>
5: Providing another random number for the computer in case the sum of the numbers already given is less than 17.<br/>
6: Updating the score accordingly and displaying them.<br/>
